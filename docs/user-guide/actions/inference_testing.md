# Evaluating Experiments with Inference Testing

For guidance on using inference testing to evaluate an experiment, refer to the topics shown below.

* For `nctl predict` command, its subcommands and parameters information, refer to [predict Commands](predict.md).

* For _how to instructions_ for running batch inference, refer to: [Batch Inference Example](batch_inf_example.md).

* For _how to instructions_ for running streaming inference, refer to: [Stream Inference Example](streaming_inference.md).



* For running prediction on OpenVINO Model Server, refer to [Inference Example on OpenVINO Model Server](openvino_inf.md)
