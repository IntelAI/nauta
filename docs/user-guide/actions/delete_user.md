# Deleting a User Account

Only an Administrator can delete user accounts. Deleting a user removes that user's account from the Nauta software and removes log in access to the system. The command halts and removes all experiments and pods; however, all artifacts related to that user's account, such as, the user's input and output folders and all data related to past experiments will remain. To create a User Account, refer to [Creating a User Account](../actions/create_user.md). 

This section discusses the following main topics:

- [Removing a User](#removing-a-user)
- [Using the Purge Command](#using-the-purge-command)

## Removing a User

To remove a user, execute the following command:

  `nctl user delete <username>`

This command asks for confirmation. 

`Do you want to continue? [y/N]: press y to confirm deletion.`

### Limitations	

The command may take up to 30 seconds to delete the user and you may receive the message: _User is still being deleted_. Check the status of the user in a while. Recheck, as desired.

## Using the Purge Command

To permanently remove (_Purge_) all artifacts associated with the user, including all data related to past experiments submitted by that user (but excluding the contents of the userâ€™s input and output folders):

### Purging Process

To purge a user, execute the following command: 

  `nctl user delete <username>  --purge`
  
This command asks for confirmation. 

`Do you want to continue? [y/N]: press y to confirm deletion.`

### Limitations	

The Nauta `user delete` command may take up to 30 seconds to delete the user. A new user with the same user name _cannot_ be created until after the delete command confirms that the first user with the same name has been deleted.
