# Installation Process

Before proceeding with this step, you _must_ create an _Inventory_ and _Configuration_ file. If you are unsure how to do this, see the example [Inventory File Information](../Inventory_Tasks/IT.md) and [Configuration File Information](../Configuration_Tasks_Variables/CTV.md) then refer to the instructions below. 

This section discusses the following main topics: 

- [Kernel Upgrade](#kernel-upgrade)
- [Nauta Installation](#nauta-installation)
- [Installation Script Options](#installation-script-options)
- [Access Files for the kubectl Client](#access-files-for-the-kubectl-client)  
- [Upgrading Nauta](#upgrading-nauta)
- [Deleting Nauta](#deleting-nauta)  

## Kernel Upgrade

If you run Linux kernel prior to 4.* version it is recommended that you upgrade it on all nodes of a cluster before performing a platform installation. 

Running heavy training jobs on workers with the operating system kernel older than 4.* may lead to hanging the worker node. 
- See [Red Hat Bugzilla â€“ Bug 1507149](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1507149) for more information.

This may occur when a memory limit for a training job is set to a value close to the maximum amount of memory installed on this node. These problems are caused by errors in handling memory limits in older versions of the kernel.

The following kernel was verified as a viable fix for this issue (see link below).

- [Index of /linux/kernel/el7/x86_64/RPMS](https://elrepo.org/linux/kernel/el7/x86_64/RPMS/)

To install the new kernel refer to: [CHAPTER 5. MANUALLY UPGRADING THE KERNEL](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/kernel_administration_guide/ch-manually_upgrading_the_kernel) in Red Hat's* Kernel Administration Guide.

**Note:** The above kernel _does not_ include Red Hat's optimizations and hardware drivers.

## Nauta Installation

Before installing Nauta, ensure that you have met all the hardware and software requirements.  

### Nauta Installation Procedure

To install Nauta, follow these steps:

1. Set the following environment variables that point to the configuration and inventory file on the _Installer Machine_.

* **ENV_INVENTORY (mandatory):** Inventory file location, for example:
  
`export ENV_INVENTORY=<absolute path to inventory file>`
  
* **ENV_CONFIG (mandatory):** Configuration file location, for example:

`export ENV_CONFIG=<absolute path to config file>`
   
2. Run the installation:

`./installer.sh install`

## Installation Script Options

Invoke `./installer.sh` with one of the following options:

* **install:** Use this option to install Kubernetes and Nauta as part of your installation
* **platform-install:** Use this option to install **Kubernetes only**
* **nauta-install:** Use this option to install **Nauta only**
    - **Note:** If you select this option, it is _assumed_ that Kubernetes is already installed. In addition, this requires the same procedure for Nauta upgrades (see below). 
* **nauta-upgrade:** Nauta installation upgrade (see [Upgrading Nauta](#upgrading-nauta) for Nauta upgrade  procedures). 

### Installation Output 

Nauta is installed on cluster nodes in the following folders: `/opt/nauta`,`/usr/bin`, `/etc/nauta-cluster`

## Access Files for the kubectl Client

On your _Installer Machine_, the following files are created in the Installation folder. These files are *access files* used to connect to the cluster using kubectl client.

As an output of Kubernetes* installation, files are created in the main installation directory:

`platform-admin.config - cluster admin config file`

As an output of the Nauta installation, files are created in main installation directory:

`nauta-admin.config - NAUTA admin config file`

## Upgrading Nauta 

As an admin, you may be required to upgrade Nauta to gain new features, implement new networking configurations, or stay up-to-date with current versions, and so on. 

## Upgrading Nauta

To upgrade Nauta, do the following:

1. Set the following environment variables that point to the configuration, inventory and configuration file on the Installer Machine:

* **ENV_INVENTORY (mandatory):** Inventory file location, for example:
  
`export ENV_INVENTORY=<absolute path to inventory file>`
  
* **ENV_CONFIG (mandatory):** Configuration file location, for example:

`export ENV_CONFIG=<absolute path to config file>`

* **NAUTA_KUBECONFIG (mandatory): ** Nauta admin file location, for example:

`export NAUTA_KUBECONFIG=<absolute path to nauta-admin.config file>`
   
2. Call the installer with nauta-upgrade option:

`./installer.sh nauta-upgrade`

**Note:** It is recommended that you _do not_ use the cluster during an upgrade.

This completes the Nauta Upgrade Process.
